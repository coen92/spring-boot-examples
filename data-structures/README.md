# Data Structures & Algorithms

## Definitions:
### What's a data structure?
Data Structure - a named location that can be used to store and organize data (f.e. tree, array).

### What's an algorithm?
Algorithm - a collection of steps to solve particular problem (f.e. linear search).


To write a code that is both time and memory efficient you need to know this one. 
Also, it is pretty good to know your drill as a programmer, don't you think?


## Data Structures:
### Stack
#### 1. characteristics:
- LIFO (Last-In First-Out) data structure 
- stores objects into a sort of "vertical tower"
- push() to add item to the top
- pop() to remove item from the top
- peak() to return item without removing it

#### 2. usages:
- undo/redo features (f.e. in text editors)
- moving back/forward (f.e. through browser history)
- backtracking algorithms
- calling functions (call stack)

### Queue
##### 1. characteristics
- FIFO (First-In First-Out) data structure
- linear data structure
- collection designed for holding elements prior processing
- add = enqueue, offer()
- remove = dequeue, poll()

#### 2. usages:
- keyboard buffer - letters appear on the screen in the order they were pressed on keyboard
- printer queue - print jobs should be completed in order
- in LinkedLists, PriorityQueues, Breadth-first search
